## Part 1: Importing files, data wrangling, mathematical operations, plots and saving code on GitHub

### Gene Expression Analysis

#### 1. Read in the file and show table with first six genes
The below reads in the file “gene_expression.tsv” making the gene identifiers the row names. The `head()` function in R then displays a table of values for the first six genes. By default, `head()` shows 6 rows but we could also specify the rows through specifying the number of rows i.e. `head(gene_data, n=6)`.

```{r}
# Read in data (tab separated)
gene_data <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")

# Show first six rows
head(gene_data)
```

#### 2. Add mean column

We make a new column which is the mean of the other columns. The first six genes is displayed again through the `head()` function.

```{r}
gene_data$mean <- rowMeans(gene_data)
head(gene_data)
```

#### 3. List top 10 genes with highest mean expression

The top 10 genes with the highest mean expression is shown.

```{r}
top_genes <- head(gene_data[order(-gene_data$mean), ], 10)
top_genes
```


#### 4. Determine the number of genes with a mean <10

Create variable `low_mean_count` and store the total number of mean values <10. When returning the `low_mean_count` value, we receive 35988 genes with a mean <10.

```{r}
low_mean_count <- sum(gene_data$mean < 10)
low_mean_count
```

#### 5. Make a histogram plot of the mean values and include it into your report.


```{r}
hist(gene_data$mean, 
     breaks = 100, 
     xlim = c(0, 550000), 
     ylim = c(0, 60000), 
     main = "Histogram of Mean Gene Expression", 
     xlab = "Mean Expression")
```


### Growth Data Analysis

#### 6. Import this csv file into an R object. What are the column names?
```{r}
growth_data <- read.csv("growth_data.csv", header = TRUE)
colnames(growth_data)
```

#### 7. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at both sites.
Sites are "northeast" or "southwest". Columns suggest start of study is 2005 and end of study is 2020

```{r}
stats <- data.frame(
  Site = unique(growth_data$Site),
  mean_2005 = tapply(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, growth_data$Site, mean),
  sd_2005   = tapply(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, growth_data$Site, sd),
  mean_2020 = tapply(growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm, growth_data$Site, mean),
  sd_2020   = tapply(growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm, growth_data$Site, sd)
)
stats
```
#### 8. Make a box plot of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at both sites.
```{r}
# Create combined vector of circumference values
circumference <- c(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm)

# Create corresponding Site labels
site <- rep(growth_data$Site, 2)

# Create corresponding Year labels
year <- c(rep("2005", nrow(growth_data)), rep("2020", nrow(growth_data)))

# Combine Site and Year into one factor
site_year <- interaction(site, year)

# Make nicer labels
levels(site_year) <- c("Northeast 2005", "Southwest 2005",
                       "Northeast 2020", "Southwest 2020")

# Box plot
boxplot(circumference ~ site_year,
        main = "Tree Circumference at Start (2005) and End (2020)",
        xlab = "Site and Year",
        ylab = "Circumference (cm)",
        col = c("goldenrod", "cornflowerblue", "goldenrod", "cornflowerblue"))
```


#### 9. Calculate the mean growth over the last 10 years at each site.
It looks like 
Northeast site: 42.94 cm
Southwest site: 35.49 cm
So, on average, trees at the northeast site grew ~7.45 cm more over the last 10 years than trees at the southwest site.
```{r}
# Calculate 10-year growth per tree using 2020 and 2010
growth_data$growth10yr <- growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm - growth_data$Circumf_2010_cm

# Mean growth per site
aggregate(growth10yr ~ Site, data = growth_data, mean)
```

#### 10. Use the t.test to estimate the p-value that the 10 year growth is different at the two sites.
A Welch two-sample t-test indicated that this difference was not statistically significant (t = 1.8882, df = 87.978, p = 0.06229), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.39 to 15.29 cm. The p-value is slightly above the common significance threshold of 0.05.

```{r}
t.test(growth10yr ~ Site, data = growth_data)
```

## Part 2: Examining biological sequence diversity
As part of your assignment, you will study one of the following organisms and compare its sequence features to E. coli.

### Information
Organism allocated: Acetobacter aceti (GCA_002005445)

#### 1. Download the whole set of coding DNA sequences for E. coli and your organism of interest. How many coding sequences are present in these organisms? Present this in the form of a table. Describe any differences between the two organisms. 
Placeholder:
* Describe how you solved the problem. 
* Provide the answer or answers as directed. The answers could include numerical or categorical data, tables or charts.

Load packages needed:
```{r loading packages}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library("seqinr") # is a package designed to process and analyse sequence data.
  library("R.utils") # general utilities like zip and unzip
  library("ggplot2") # for graphs
})
```

Download both E. coli (GCA_000005845) and A. aceti (GCA_002005445) from Ensembl
```{r}
#E. coli
URL="https://ftp.ensemblgenomes.ebi.ac.uk/pub/bacteria/release-62/fasta/bacteria_0_collection/escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655_gca_000005845/cds/Escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655_gca_000005845.ASM584v2.cds.all.fa.gz"
download.file(URL,destfile="ecoli_cds.fa.gz")
gunzip("ecoli_cds.fa.gz")

#A. aceti
URL="https://ftp.ensemblgenomes.ebi.ac.uk/pub/bacteria/release-62/fasta/bacteria_80_collection/acetobacter_aceti_gca_002005445/cds/Acetobacter_aceti_gca_002005445.ASM200544v1.cds.all.fa.gz"
download.file(URL,destfile="aaceti_cds.fa.gz")
gunzip("aaceti_cds.fa.gz")
list.files()
```
Figure out the number of coding sequences (cds) and present in a table.
```{r}
ecoli_cds <- seqinr::read.fasta("ecoli_cds.fa")
aaceti_cds <- seqinr::read.fasta("aaceti_cds.fa")

cds_table <- data.frame(
  Organism = c("E. coli", "A. aceti"),
  CDS_Count = c(length(ecoli_cds), length(aaceti_cds))
)

cds_table
```
E. coli has around 837 more coding sequences than A. aceti.


#### 2. How much coding DNA is there in total for these two organisms? Present this in the form of a table. Describe any differences between the two organisms.

```{r}
head(summary(aaceti_cds))
```
We want all rows and first column in the cds files to be summed. This is the total length of all genes.
```{r}
# Total coding DNA from the length column
ecoli_len <- as.numeric(summary(ecoli_cds)[,1])
aaceti_len <- as.numeric(summary(aaceti_cds)[,1])

#this is q2 or 3?
# Sum of all the lengths within the organism 
ecoli_total <- sum(ecoli_len)
aaceti_total <- sum(aaceti_len)

# Create table
DNA_total <- data.frame(
  Organism = c("E. coli", "A. aceti"),
  Total_DNA = c(ecoli_total, aaceti_total)
)

# Print table
DNA_total
```
The total coding DNA in E. coli is about 740000 base pairs greater than in A. aceti. This difference is consistent with its larger number of genes as noted in section 1.

#### 3. Calculate the length of all coding sequences in these two organisms. Make a boxplot of coding sequence length in these organisms. What is the mean and median coding sequence length of these two organisms? Describe any differences between the two organisms.

```{r}
# Boxplot of CDS lengths - check if this is ecoli_len or is it the sum (ecoli_total)
boxplot(list("E. coli" = ecoli_len, "A. aceti" = aaceti_len),
        main = "Distribution of coding sequence lengths (box plot)",
        ylab = "Sequence Length (bp)",
        col = c("skyblue", "plum1"))

# Calculate mean and median CDS length
cds_stats <- data.frame(
  Organism = c("E. coli", "A. aceti"),
  Mean_CDS_Length = c(mean(ecoli_len), mean(aaceti_len)),
  Median_CDS_Length = c(median(ecoli_len), median(aaceti_len))
)

# Print table to show means and medians
cds_stats
```
On average, A.aceti coding sequences are longer than those in E. coli (approximately 12 bp difference) but this is very small relative to the overall sequence length and might not be biologically significant.

The median coding sequence length is also longer in E. coli (831 bp vs 819 bp), which suggests that E. coli has a slightly more balanced distribution of gene lengths, whereas A. aceti may have a few longer genes that increase its mean.

The fact that A. aceti has a higher mean but a lower median implies its coding sequence length distribution might be more skewed, with some unusually long genes pulling the mean upward.

#### 4. Calculate the frequency of DNA bases in the total coding sequences for both organisms. Perform the same calculation for the total protein sequence. Create bar plots for nucleotide and amino acid frequency. Describe any differences between the two organisms.

Frequency of DNA bases per organism. To count the entire genome we use `unlist`.
```{r}
# Concatenate all CDS into one sequence per organism
ecoli_seq <- unlist(ecoli_cds)
aaceti_seq <- unlist(aaceti_cds)

# Count combinations of 1s of the nucleotides in entire DNA
ecoli_dna_composition <- count(ecoli_seq,1)
aaceti_dna_composition <- count(aaceti_seq,1)
# Relative frequencies
ecoli_nt_freq <- ecoli_dna_composition/sum(ecoli_dna_composition)
aaceti_nt_freq <- aaceti_dna_composition/sum(aaceti_dna_composition)

ecoli_nt_freq 
aaceti_nt_freq

#Barplots. `las=1` to make the labels horizontal only
barplot(ecoli_dna_composition, 
        xlab="Nucleotides", 
        ylab="Frequency", 
        main="E. coli CDS composition", 
        las=1, 
        col="skyblue")
barplot(aaceti_dna_composition, 
        xlab="Nucleotides", 
        ylab="Frequency", 
        main="A. aceti CDS composition", 
        las=1, 
        col="plum1")

#We can also plot our nucleotide frequencies
barplot(ecoli_nt_freq , 
        xlab="Nucleotides", 
        ylab="Proportion", 
        main="E. coli CDS composition", 
        las=1, 
        col="skyblue")
grid()
barplot(aaceti_nt_freq, 
        xlab="Nucleotides", 
        ylab="Proportion", 
        main="A. aceti CDS composition", 
        las=1, 
        col="plum1")
grid()
```
E. coli and A. aceti differ noticeably in base composition.
E. coli: more balanced between A/T (both ~24%) and G/C (~25–27%).
A. aceti: relatively GC-rich, with higher C (28%) and G (29.6%) but lower A (20%) and T (21.8%).
This indicates that A. aceti has a higher GC content compared to E. coli, which could influence genome stability, codon usage, and gene expression.


## Translation shows the protein sequence of the genes
```{r}
#unlist and use lapply to translate entire genome
ecoli_prot <- unlist(lapply(ecoli_cds, translate))
aaceti_prot <- unlist(lapply(aaceti_cds, translate))
```


We can use the prot list to get any useful information, such as the number of unique amino acids. aa <- unique(prot[[2]]) extracts these amino acids, aa <- aa[aa != "*"] removes any asterisks for unknown amino acids, and length(aa) counts the remaining unique amino acids.
```{r}
aa <- unique(ecoli_prot)
aa <- aa[aa != "*"]
length(aa)

aa1 <- unique(aaceti_prot)
aa1 <- aa1[aa1 != "*"]
length(aa1)

count(ecoli_prot,wordsize=1,alphabet=aa)
count(aaceti_prot,wordsize=1,alphabet=aa1)
```


Calculate the frequency of protein sequences for both organisms. 
```{r}
# Count amino acids
ecoli_aa_freq <- table(ecoli_prot)
aaceti_aa_freq <- table(aaceti_prot)
#Print out tables of amino acid frequencies
ecoli_aa_freq 
aaceti_aa_freq

# Convert to proportions to view as a whole (different graph below)
ecoli_aa_proportion <- ecoli_aa_freq / sum(ecoli_aa_freq)
aaceti_aa_proportion <- aaceti_aa_freq / sum(aaceti_aa_freq)

# Protein amino acid frequencies
barplot(ecoli_aa_freq,
        main="E. coli Amino Acid Frequency",
        ylab="Frequency", 
        col="skyblue", 
        las=1)
grid()

barplot(aaceti_aa_freq,
        main="A. aceti Amino Acid Frequency",
        ylab="Frequency", 
        col="plum1", 
        las=1)
grid()

# Protein amino acid proportion graphs
barplot(ecoli_aa_proportion,
        main="E. coli Amino Acid Proportion",
        ylab="Proportion", 
        col="skyblue", 
        las=1)
grid()

barplot(aaceti_aa_proportion,
        main="A. aceti Amino Acid Proportion",
        ylab="Proportion", 
        col="plum1", 
        las=1)
grid()

```


Checking only - do we want a table to compare?
```{r}
# DNA nucleotide frequency table
nt_freq_table <- data.frame(
  Base = union(names(ecoli_nt_freq), names(aaceti_nt_freq)),
  E_coli = as.numeric(ecoli_nt_freq[union(names(ecoli_nt_freq), names(aaceti_nt_freq))]),
  A_aceti = as.numeric(aaceti_nt_freq[union(names(ecoli_nt_freq), names(aaceti_nt_freq))])
)

# Replace NAs with 0
nt_freq_table[is.na(nt_freq_table)] <- 0

knitr::kable(nt_freq_table, digits=4,
             col.names = c("Base", "E. coli (Proportion)", "A. aceti (Proportion)"))

# Amino acid frequency table
aa_freq_table <- data.frame(
  AminoAcid = union(names(ecoli_aa_proportion), names(aaceti_aa_proportion)),
  E_coli = as.numeric(ecoli_aa_proportion[union(names(ecoli_aa_proportion), names(aaceti_aa_proportion))]),
  A_aceti = as.numeric(aaceti_aa_proportion[union(names(ecoli_aa_proportion), names(aaceti_aa_proportion))])
)

# Replace NAs with 0
aa_freq_table[is.na(aa_freq_table)] <- 0

knitr::kable(aa_freq_table, digits=4,
             col.names = c("Amino Acid", "E. coli (Proportion)", "A. aceti (Proportion)"))
```

#### 5. Create a codon usage table and quantify the codon usage bias among all coding sequences. Describe any differences between the two organisms with respect to their codon usage bias. Provide charts to support your observations.

A codon is a three base triplet that codes for a particular amino acid. As there are 64 possible codons and just 20 amino acids (and 3 termination codons), some amino acids are coded by multiple codons. For example, leucine is coded by six codons that are synonymous for it.

`seqinr` has a command called `uco` which calculates some codon usage information.

The RSCU stands for relative synonymous codon usage, which is a measure as to how preferred a codon of a particular amino acid is compared to the other codons which also encode it. A value of 1 indicating that the codon is used as expected. Values above 1 suggest that the codon is used more frequently than expected, while values below 1 indicate lower usage.
RSCU ≈ 1 = codon used as expected.
RSCU > 1 = codon is preferred.
RSCU < 1 = codon is under-represented


```{r}
# Codon usage tables
# Concatenate all CDS into one long sequence and get codon frequencies
ecoli_codon <- uco(unlist(ecoli_cds),index="rscu", as.data.frame = TRUE)
aaceti_codon <- uco(unlist(aaceti_cds), index = "rscu", as.data.frame = TRUE)

#View both tables
ecoli_codon
aaceti_codon
```

We can also display bar plots to visualise codon usage
`las=2` to keep it vertical
The red dashed line at RSCU = 1 shows where codons would be equally used
```{r}

#store as non-dataframe for below graphs
ecoli_rscu <- uco(unlist(ecoli_cds),index="rscu")
aaceti_rscu <- uco(unlist(aaceti_cds), index = "rscu")

barplot(ecoli_rscu, las=2, cex.names=0.6,
        main="E. coli RSCU", ylab="RSCU", col="skyblue")
abline(h=1, col="red", lty=2)

barplot(aaceti_rscu, las=2, cex.names=0.6,
        main="A. aceti RSCU", ylab="RSCU", col="plum1")
abline(h=1, col="red", lty=2)
```

However, it is better if we could look at the RSCU of both organisms side by side.
We can combine `ecoli_codon` and `aaceti_codon` into one table with the amino acid and codon columns.
```{r}
# Make sure RSCU columns have unique names
colnames(ecoli_codon)[colnames(ecoli_codon) == "RSCU"] <- "RSCU_Ecoli"
colnames(aaceti_codon)[colnames(aaceti_codon) == "RSCU"] <- "RSCU_Aaceti"

# Merge by Codon (you can keep either AA column; they should match)
rscu_table <- merge(ecoli_codon[, c("codon", "AA", "RSCU_Ecoli")],
                    aaceti_codon[, c("codon", "RSCU_Aaceti")],
                    by = "codon")

# Reorder columns
rscu_table <- rscu_table[, c("codon", "AA", "RSCU_Ecoli", "RSCU_Aaceti")]

# print table
rscu_table

```


###Visualising codon usage bias


```{r}
# Create a matrix of RSCU values: rows = organisms, cols = codons
rscu_matrix <- rbind(rscu_table$RSCU_Ecoli, rscu_table$RSCU_Aaceti)
rownames(rscu_matrix) <- c("E. coli", "A. aceti")
colnames(rscu_matrix) <- rscu_table$codon

# Create barplot
barplot(rscu_matrix,
        beside = TRUE,                    # side-by-side bars
        col = c("skyblue", "plum1"),
        las = 2,                          # rotate x-axis labels vertically
        cex.names = 0.7,                  # smaller font for codon names
        ylim = c(0, max(rscu_matrix) * 1.2),
        main = "Codon Usage Bias (RSCU values)",
        ylab = "RSCU",
        xlab = "Codon",
        names.arg = colnames(rscu_matrix) # explicit x-axis labels
)

# Add legend
legend("topright", legend = rownames(rscu_matrix), fill = c("skyblue", "plum1"))

# Add red dashed line at RSCU = 1
abline(h = 1, col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```
Not sure if this is useful if difficult to label the AA (to delete?)
```{r}
# 1. Order codons by Amino Acid
rscu_table <- rscu_table[order(rscu_table$AA, rscu_table$codon), ]

# 2. Create matrix of RSCU values (rows = organisms, columns = codons)
rscu_matrix <- rbind(rscu_table$RSCU_Ecoli, rscu_table$RSCU_Aaceti)
rownames(rscu_matrix) <- c("E. coli", "A. aceti")
colnames(rscu_matrix) <- rscu_table$codon

# 3. Create color separators for amino acids
aa_changes <- which(rscu_table$AA[-1] != rscu_table$AA[-nrow(rscu_table)])  # positions where AA changes
aa_positions <- aa_changes + 0.5  # place separators between codons

# 4. Base R barplot
bp <- barplot(rscu_matrix,
              beside = TRUE,
              col = c("skyblue", "plum1"),
              names.arg = colnames(rscu_matrix),
              las = 2,
              cex.names = 0.7,
              ylim = c(0, max(rscu_matrix) * 1.2),
              main = "Codon Usage Bias (RSCU values) by Amino Acid",
              ylab = "RSCU",
              xlab = "Codon")

# 5. Add legend
legend("topright", legend = rownames(rscu_matrix), fill = c("skyblue", "plum1"))

# 6. Add red dashed line at RSCU = 1
abline(h = 1, col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2)

# 7. Add vertical lines to separate amino acids
abline(v = bp[1, aa_positions], col = "grey50", lty = 3)
```


Are we allowed to use a heatmap for codon bias using ggplot2?
```{r}
# Convert to data frames to prepare for heat map (different to the rscu_table)
df_ecoli <- data.frame(
  Codon = names(ecoli_rscu),
  RSCU = as.numeric(ecoli_rscu),
  Organism = "E. coli"
)

df_aaceti <- data.frame(
  Codon = names(aaceti_rscu),
  RSCU = as.numeric(aaceti_rscu),
  Organism = "A. aceti"
)

# Combine
rscu_all <- rbind(df_ecoli, df_aaceti)

# Plot heat map with ggplot2
ggplot(rscu_all, aes(x = Codon, y = Organism, fill = RSCU)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue4", mid = "white", high = "deeppink4",
                       midpoint = 1, name = "RSCU") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Codon Usage Bias Heatmap (RSCU values)",
       x = "Codon", y = "Organism")

```


#### 6. In the organism of interest, identify 10 protein sequence k-mers of length 3-5 which are the most over- and under-represented k-mers in your organism of interest. Are these k-mers also over- and under-represented in E. coli to a similar extent? Provide plots to support your observations. Why do you think these sequences are present at different levels in the genomes of these organisms?

Before we already translated the CDS to protein sequences...
K-mer is simply a short sequence string of length k. We can use k-mer analysis to identify particular sequences that are over- or under-represented in an organism.
```{r}
#we counted unique aa in ecoli earlier and stored as aa (E. coli) and aa1 (A. aceti)

# Example for 3 k-mers
ecoli_kmer <- unlist(ecoli_prot)
aaceti_kmer <- unlist(aaceti_prot)

ecoli_k3 <- count(ecoli_kmer,wordsize=3,alphabet=aa)
aaceti_k3 <- count(aaceti_kmer,wordsize=3,alphabet=aa1)

#check
head(ecoli_k3)
head(aaceti_k3)

#Convert counts to frequency so the different proteome sizes don't bias the comparison
ecoli_k3_freq <- count(ecoli_kmer,wordsize=3,alphabet=aa,freq=TRUE)
head(ecoli_k3_freq)
aaceti_k3_freq <- count(aaceti_kmer,wordsize=3,alphabet=aa1,freq=TRUE)
head(aaceti_k3_freq)

```
```{r}
k3_table <- data.frame(
    Ecoli = ecoli_k3_freq,
  Aaceti = aaceti_k3_freq
)

k3_table
```
Finding the top 10 over and under represented k-mers in A. aceti for length 3
This just plots the bar graph with both top and bottom -Can separate this if it looks better?

Still yet to: "Are these k-mers also over- and under-represented in E. coli to a similar extent?"
We could pull out the same kmers as the k3_table would have e. coli 
```{r}
over_k3_aaceti <- head(k3_table[order(-k3_table$Aaceti.Freq), ], 10)
under_k3_aaceti <- head(k3_table[order(k3_table$Aaceti.Freq), ], 10)

aaceti_top_k3 <- rbind(over_k3_aaceti, under_k3_aaceti)

barplot(height = aaceti_top_k3$Aaceti.Freq,
