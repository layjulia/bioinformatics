### Part 1: Importing files, data wrangling, mathematical operations, plots and saving code on GitHub

Part 1 files were downloaded from: https://github.com/ghazkha/Assessment4

### Part 2: Examining biological sequence diversity

Organisms used in this section are:

* [Escherichia coli (GCA_000005845)](https://bacteria.ensembl.org/Escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655_gca_000005845/Info/Index/)
* [Acetobacter aceti (GCA_002005445)](https://bacteria.ensembl.org/Acetobacter_aceti_gca_002005445/Info/Index)

_A. aceti_ (GCA_002005445) is the allocated organism and is compared to the _E. coli_ genome.
